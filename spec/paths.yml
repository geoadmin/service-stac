        Every feature in a dataset belongs to a collection. A dataset may
        consist of multiple feature collections. A feature collection is often a
        collection of features of a similar type, based on a common schema.

        Retrieve Items matching filters. Intended as a shorthand API for simple
        queries.


        This method is optional, but you MUST implement `POST /search` if you
        want to implement this method.


        If this endpoint is implemented on a server, it is required to add a
        link referring to this endpoint with `rel` set to `search` to the
        `links` array in `GET /`. As `GET` is the default method, the `method`
        may not be set explicitly in the link.
