        Information about the feature collection with id `collectionId`.

        The response contains a link to the items in the collection
        (path `/collections/{collectionId}/items`, link relation `items`)
        as well as key information about the collection. This information
        includes:

        * A local identifier for the collection that is unique for the dataset;
        * A list of coordinate reference systems (CRS) in which geometries may be returned by the server. The first CRS is the default coordinate reference system (the default is always WGS 84 with axis order longitude/latitude);
        * An optional title and description for the collection;
        * An optional extent that can be used to provide an indication of the spatial and temporal extent of the collection - typically derived from the data;
        * An optional indicator about the type of the items in the collection (the default value, if the indicator is not provided, is 'feature').

        The feature collections shared by this API.

        The dataset is organized as one or more feature collections. This resource
        provides information about and access to the collections.

        The response contains the list of collections. For each collection, a link
        to the items in the collection (path `/collections/{collectionId}/items`,
        link relation `items`) as well as key information about the collection.

        The URIs of all conformance classes supported by the server.

        To support "generic" clients that want to access multiple
        OGC API Features implementations - and not "just" a specific
        API / server, the server declares the conformance
        classes it implements and conforms to.

        The response is a document consisting of features in the collection.
        The features included in the response are determined by the server
        based on the query parameters of the request. To support access to
        larger collections without overloading the client, the API supports
        paged access with links to the next page, if more features are selected
        that the page size.

        The `bbox` and `datetime` parameter can be used to select only a
        subset of the features in the collection (the features that are in the
        bounding box or time interval). The `bbox` parameter matches all features
        in the collection that are not associated with a location, too. The
        `datetime` parameter matches all features in the collection that are
        not associated with a time stamp or interval, too.

        The `limit` parameter may be used to control the subset of the
        selected features that should be returned in the response, the page size.
        Each page may include information about the number of selected and
        returned features (`numberMatched` and `numberReturned`) as well as
        links to support paging (link relation `next`).
