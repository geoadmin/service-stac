The GSD of a sensor can vary depending \non off-nadir and wavelength, so it is at the discretion of the \nimplementer to decide which value most accurately represents the GSD. \nFor example, Landsat8 optical and short-wave IR bands are all 30 meters, \nbut the panchromatic band is 15 meters. The eo:gsd should be 30 meters in \nthis case because that is nominal spatial resolution at the sensor. The \nPlanet PlanetScope Ortho Tile Product has an eo:gsd of 3.7 (or 4 if rounding), \neven though the pixel size of the images is 3.125.

                boxes describes the spatial extent.

                description: |-
                  Each bounding box is provided as four or six numbers, depending on
                  whether the coordinate reference system includes a vertical axis
                  (height or depth):

                  * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1

                  * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2
                  * Maximum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)

                  The coordinate reference system of the values is WGS 84 longitude/latitude
                  (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84) unless a different coordinate
                  reference system is specified in `crs`.

                  For WGS 84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the sequence of
                  minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum latitude.
                  However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the first value
                  (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value (east-most box edge).

                  If the vertical axis is included, the third and the sixth number are
                  the bottom and the top of the 3-dimensional bounding box.

                  If a feature has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is the decision of the
                  server whether only a single spatial geometry property is used to determine
                  the extent or all relevant geometries.
