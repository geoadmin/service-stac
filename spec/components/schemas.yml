      description: >-
        Only features that have a geometry that intersects the bounding box are selected.
        The bounding box is provided as four numbers:


        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1

        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2

        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1

        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2


        The coordinate reference system of the values is WGS84
        longitude/latitude (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84).


        For WGS84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the sequence
        of minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum
        latitude. However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the
        first value (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value
        (east-most box edge).


        Example: The bounding box of Switzerland in
        WGS 84 (from 5.96°E to 10.49°E and from 45.82°N to 47.81°N) would be
        represented in JSON as `[5.96, 45.82, 10.49, 47.81]` and in a query as
        `bbox=5.96,45.82,10.49,47.81`."

      description: >-
        GSD is the nominal Ground Sample Distance for the data, as measured in meters on the ground.


        There are many definitions of GSD. The value of this attribute should be related to the
        spatial resolution at the sensor, rather than the pixel size of images after ortho-rectification,
        pansharpening, or scaling. The GSD of a sensor can vary depending on off-nadir and
        wavelength, so it is at the discretion of the implementer to decide which value most
        accurately represents the GSD. For example, Landsat8 optical and short-wave IR bands are
        all 30 meters, but the panchromatic band is 15 meters. The eo:gsd should be 30 meters in
        this case because that is nominal spatial resolution at the sensor. The Planet PlanetScope
        Ortho Tile Product has an eo:gsd of 3.7 (or 4 if rounding), even though the pixel size of
        the images is 3.125. For example, one might choose for WorldView-2 the Multispectral 20°
        off-nadir value of 2.07 and for WorldView-3 the Multispectral 20° off-nadir value of 1.38.

    extent:
      description: >-
        The extent of the features in the collection. In the Core only spatial and temporal
        extents are specified. Extensions may add additional members to represent other
        extents, for example, thermal or pressure ranges.

            bbox:
              description: >-
                One or more bounding boxes that describe the spatial extent of the dataset.
                In the Core only a single bounding box is supported. Extensions may support
                additional areas. If multiple areas are provided, the union of the bounding
                boxes describes the spatial extent.
              items:
                description: >-
                  Each bounding box is provided as four or six numbers, depending on
                  whether the coordinate reference system includes a vertical axis
                  (height or depth):


                  * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1

                  * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2

                  * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1

                  * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2


                  The coordinate reference system of the values is WGS 84 longitude/latitude
                  (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84).


                  For WGS 84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the sequence of
                  minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum latitude.
                  However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the first value
                  (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value (east-most box edge).


                  If the vertical axis is included, the third and the sixth number are
                  the bottom and the top of the 3-dimensional bounding box.


                  If a feature has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is the decision of the
                  server whether only a single spatial geometry property is used to determine
                  the extent or all relevant geometries.

                If merge is true, the client is expected to merge the body value
                into the current request body before following the link.
                This avoids passing large post bodies back and forth when following
                links, particularly for navigating pages through the `POST /search`
