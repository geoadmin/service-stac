      description: >-
        The RFC7232 `If-None-Match` header field makes the GET request method conditional. It is
        composed of a comma separated list of ETags or value "*".


        The server compares the client's ETags (sent with `If-None-Match`) with the ETag for its
        current version of the resource, and if both values match (that is, the resource has not changed),
        the server sends back a `304 Not Modified` status, without a body, which tells the client that
        the cached version of the response is still good to use (fresh).
