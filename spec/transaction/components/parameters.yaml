        The RFC7232 `If-Match` header field makes the PUT/PATCH/DEL request method conditional. It is
        composed of a comma separated list of ETags or value "*".


        The server compares the client's ETags (sent with `If-Match`) with the ETag for its
        current version of the resource, and if both values don't match (that is, the resource has changed),
        the server sends back a `412 Precondition Failed` status, without a body, which tells the client that
        he would overwrite another changes of the resource.
      example: "d01af8b8ebbf899e30095be8754b377ddb0f0ed0f7fddbc33ac23b0d1969736b"
