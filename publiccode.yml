    shortDescription: The STAC API to interact with Swiss federal geodata
    longDescription: The STAC API of geo.admin.ch consists of standardized RESTful
      API endpoints designed for interacting with federal geodata. All datasets
      are organized according to the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC)
      specification, which simplifies data discovery and usage. This STAC API
      implementation conforms to the core STAC API specification. The underlying
      data model follows the STAC schema and is extended by the forecast
      extension to support weather forecast data.
